# Verilog Digital Clock
Digital clock with HH:MM:SS format that counts to 23:59:59 and then loops back to 00:00:00


# Clock Usage
### **Tech Used: Verilog, Artix-7 FPGA**

The digital clock runs on a Artix-7 FPGA and utilizes six 7-Segment Displays to display the time in HH:MM:SS format. Clock also has two input switches: One to enable/disable the clock and other to reset it back to 00:00:00  

To use clock,
